# This is our capstone project: PartyOx

It is a Progressive Web App _(PWA)_ that allows a person (the Ox) to host a _party_ where other people (members) can join in and suggest songs. These songs can be accepted or rejected by the Ox, if accepted they go to the _queue_. The ox may remove songs from said queue to indicate that they have been played.
